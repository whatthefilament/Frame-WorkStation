# Frame WorkStation
 Desktop Conversion enclosure for Framework Laptop 

I wanted to be able to use my Framework laptop with an external GPU and rather than buying an expensive enclosure i decided to design and build my own. 

This enclosure is designed to fit the Framework laptop mainboard, Audio Board, Wifi antenna, SFX PSU, GPU and an ADT-Link eGPU adapter. 

All the printed parts are designed to mount to 4 300mm 2020 aluminum extrusions. The parts connect to the extrusions using M3 screws and M3 roll in spring loaded T Nuts

If you can find pre threaded aluminum extrusions the lid and feet can screw directly in. Otherwise you may need to tap the extrusions yourself. This is a pretty easy process. I used M6 taps and screws to hold the lid and feet on. 

I've attached some pictures and a the step file for you to review. 

I've uploaded the step files for the model as well so you can modify the frame to accept any screen you'd like. 

I look forward to everyone's feedback.
